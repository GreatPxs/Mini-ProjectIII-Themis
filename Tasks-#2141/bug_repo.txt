Hi,

Firstly thank you a lot for your great job improving this application. I have found a problem when the sort option is set to My order while default locale being set to Persian language (non-western languages such as Farsi, Arabic, etc. in general). By doing so, application crashes with message no such column: ۹۷۸۳۰۷۲۰۰۰۰۰ in which ۹۷۸۳۰۷۲۰۰۰۰۰ is in Persian digits.

There is a property inside SortHelper class defined as APPLE_EPOCH as you can see here:

Capture

This property is being used in three lines after (line 42), CALDAV_ORDER_COLUMN. String.format(...) generates string based on system default locale. So when the locale has been set to non-western languages such as Persian, numbers are transformed to Persian digits instead of ASCII digits.

In order to prevent this behavior to happen, you can easily call String.format(Locale.US, ...) to generate ASCII digits for CALDAV_ORDER_COLUMN attribute.

The error log if you need:
